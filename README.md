# Breaking the Cycle: Exercise Access & Health Equity Analysis

## 🔗 **[Explore the Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ziyin.zheng/viz/visualization_17491794421990/Mapcompare?publish=yes)**

This interactive dashboard reveals the complex relationships between exercise access, poverty, and obesity across U.S. counties. It's designed to be intuitive, actionable, and informative for policymakers, public health researchers, and community advocates.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between access to physical activity opportunities and obesity rates in U.S. counties, with particular focus on how these factors interact with socioeconomic status. By identifying exemplary counties that have successfully broken the cycle between poverty and poor health outcomes, this project aims to provide actionable insights for evidence-based public health interventions.

### Key Research Questions
- How does access to exercise facilities correlate with obesity rates across different income levels?
- Which counties have successfully broken the poverty-obesity cycle?
- What structural factors enable equitable health outcomes?
- How can communities improve exercise access to reduce health disparities?

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Public Health Researchers** seeking data-driven insights on health equity interventions
- **Policymakers** looking for evidence-based strategies to address health disparities  
- **Community Organizers** advocating for improved physical activity infrastructure
- **General Public** interested in understanding connections between environment, poverty, and health
